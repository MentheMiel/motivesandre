# English translation of *Une introduction aux motifs (motifs purs, motifs mixtes, périodes)* by Yves André

Hi! This project is a new stupid idea that I had, to translate the book *Une introduction aux motifs (motifs purs, motifs mixtes, périodes)*
by Yves André, from French to English.

I am absolutely not a professional translator, so the translation might be shaky at times.
I am a PhD student who wants to learn more about the classical theory of motives, so this
project is more of way to force myself to read this book in its entirety. If it can make the text
more accessible to non-french speakers, then it's even better!
